    <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>
    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <h3>
      Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of
      headings.
    </h3>
    <br />
    <hr />
    <br />
    <h2>Listas</h2>
    <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
      <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
      <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
      <li type="i">But, the list item elements are the same</li>
      <li type="i">Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
      <li type="i">
        You should be noticing things is this precise order, because this is an
        ordered list
      </li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    <hr />
    <br />
    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
    <p>
      <em>Sometimes</em> you need to draw attention to a particular word or
      phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other times, you need to <strong> strongly</strong> emphasize the
      importance of a word or phrase
    </p>
    <p>
      <em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em>
    </p>

    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
    <p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.</p>
